# Match You?

[中文 README](README.md)

Have you often got troubled like this:

You've taken over a new project. However, the dependency files are a mess -- they're too old to install, or the versions used in the code are different from the avaliable libraries -- or there are no dependency files at all!

You've been struggling with the dependencies for a long time, but you still have so many problems that prevent the project from working.

So you asked the ex-owner, but they just showed you that "it worked well"!

--So what do you do now?


> A) Keep struggling with the dependencies by yourself.
> 
> B) Use "Match You" by RimoChan to solve your problem!


## How to use

Just send "Match You" to your colleague and when it runs, the dependencies on their computer will be deleted! So they must re-do it!

What you do next is to stare at their computer to learn how to get the dependencies right!

<sub>(or your colleague cannot do it either, of course)</sub>


## Let's code it!

I use Python at work so I wrote for it first. Let's create PRs and delete all the dependencies!

Contents:

- Python - pip
    - mother.py
    - mother.sh
    - father.py

And don't forget one thing, the goal is to clean up the existing dependencies, not completely mess up the environment, so do not delete anything like configuration files...
